## Servo

A servo motor is a high precision motor. It could be used if you want the motor rotate it at a specific angle. 
Servo motor works on PWM(pulse width modulation) principle ie: the angle of rotation is determined by the duration of applied pulse in the control pin. 
Servo motor has 3 pins namely, VCC,GND and control pin.
