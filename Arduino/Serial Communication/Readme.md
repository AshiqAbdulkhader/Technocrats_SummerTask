## Serial Communication
 serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.
 Serial is used for communication between the Arduino board and a computer or other devices.
 It can be attained either using USB cable type A/B or the digital RX/TX pins.
